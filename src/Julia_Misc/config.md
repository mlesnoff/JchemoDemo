This script provides some tips about the installation of Julia and the building of projects. It is orientated for Windows users. 

### **1. INSTALL Julia** 

#### **Download**

- Current stable release: https://julialang.org/downloads/
- For older releases: https://julialang.org/downloads/oldreleases/

#### **Locations**

- By default, Julia is installed at (e.g. for release 1.8.3)  
*C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Julia 1.8.3*

- During the installation, no need to put a path in the PATH Variable

- Packages are installed at 
*C:\Users\your_user_name\.julia\packages*. Note: In this directory, if there is a compilation problem 
when `using package_name` and Pkg.rm is not enough, to remove the directory of the corresponding package may help 

- The pre-compiled packages are at
*C:\Users\your_user_name\.julia\compiled\v1.8*

### **2. INSTALL VSCode**

#### **Download**

- https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

#### **Location**

- By default, VsCode is installed at
*C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code*

#### **Configuration**

- Open VsCode

- Install the Julia extension within VsCode 
    - Go to the icone "Manage" (toothed wheel at the bottom left of the screen)
    - Go to "Extensions"
    - Search "Julia" in the marketplace and install it   

- Connect VsCode and a given release of Julia 
    - Icone "Manage" ==> Settings ==> Commonly used ==> Extensions ==> Julia ==> Executable path
    - Copy the full path of the location of the file "julia.exe" of the release that has to be used, 
        e.g.: *C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Julia 1.8.3\bin\julia.exe*
    - If another release (e.g. 1.8.4) has to be used in future sessions, replace this path in the same way, and re-run VsCode 

- Then a REPL (= Julia command console) can be open 
    - Icone "Manage" ==> Command Palette ==> Start REPL 
        (or Alt+J Alt+O)

### **3. GLOBAL Julia ENVIRONMENT**

An environement (= list of the used packages and their versions) is defined by files *Manifest.toml* and *Project.toml*. Note: Do not modify Manifest.toml by hand.

#### **Location** 
- The global environment (*Manifest.toml* and *Project.toml*) of a given "minor version" of Julia (e.g. 1.8) is located at 
*C:\Users\your_user_name\.julia\environments\v1.8\*
- The global environment is the same within all the releases of a given minor version (e.g. for minor version 1.8: 1.8.1, 1.8.2, etc) 

### **4. UPGRADE TO A NEW VERSION OF Julia**

Upgrade from a minor version to another minor version (e.g. from v1.7 to v1.8)
- See explanations here:
https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/faq/#How-can-I-transfer-the-list-of-installed-packages-after-updating-my-version-of-Julia?

#### **Example: Upgrade from Julia 1.8.3 to 1.9.1**

- Install the new release 1.9.1
- Update the executable path in the settings of VsCode (as indicated in Section 2) 
    and re-run VsCode
- A new directory "v1.9" should be created at 
    *C:/Users/your_user_name/.julia/environments/v1.9/*. If not, create it
- First option (safer)
    - Copy file *Project.toml* from 
        *C:/Users/your_user_name/.julia/environments/v1.8/* to 
        *C:/Users/your_user_name/.julia/environments/v1.9/*
    - In the VsCode REPL, use the "package management mode" 
    (by typing `]`) and type command `instantiate`
    - This creates the file *Manifest.toml* corresponding to 
    the contents of *Project.toml* and resolves automatically eventual compatibility constraints
- Second option
    - Copy files *Project.toml* and also *Manifest.toml* from 
    *C:/Users/your_user_name/.julia/environments/v1.8/* to 
    *C:/Users/your_user_name/.julia/environments/v1.9/*
    - This will define the same environment as under v1.8 (exactly the same package versions) but do not protect against compatibility problems with the use of v1.9

### **5. PROJECT ENVIRONMENTS WITH VsCode**

See:
- https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/
- https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/
- https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/
- https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-setup-project-environments-in-julia-ec8ae73afe9c 

In a simplified view, a project is a directory and, if this directory contains files *Project.toml* and *Manifest.toml*, the project has its own independant environment (project environment).

#### **Open an existing project** 

- Menu "File" ==> "Open Folder" or "Open Recent" 
- Select the directory of the project
- ==> VsCode locates in the corresponding path. This can be checked by typing command `pwd()` in the REPL
- If *Project.toml* and *Manifest.toml* are present, the project environment is loaded
- If the folder is not a project environment (files *Project.toml* and *Manifest.toml* not present), VsCode loads the global environment 

#### **Create a project environment from scratch**

An easy way is the following (many other ways are possible).

- Create an empty directory that will receive the project (e.g. "Nn"), for instance *D:/Users/Tmp/Nn/* 
- Menu "File" ==> "Open Folder"
- Select the directory *D:/Users/Tmp/Nn/*
- ==> VsCode locates in the corresponding path
- use the management mode (`]`) and type command `activate .`
- Install one (any) package, for instance package "StatsBse.jl" from the official Julia pckages repository 
    - In the REPL, use the management mode (`]`) and 
        type command `add StatsBase`
    - This installs the package in the environment, and creates files *Project.toml* and *Manifest.toml* in the directory
    - The project environment "Nn" is now created
- Using the management mode (`]`) in REPL, command `status` shows the installed packages in "Nn"  

#### **Activate an environment** 

Any project environment can be loaded using command `activate` in the REPL management mode (`]`). For instance, for project "Nn" already existing at location "D:/Users/Tmp/Nn/"   
- From any path location 
    -  In the management mode (`]`), run command `activate "D:/Users/Tmp/Nn"`
- or locate directly in the directory of the project and, in the management mode  (`]`), run command `activate .`
    - To locate in the repository, run in REPL
        - `path = "D:/Users/Tmp/Nn/"`
        - `cd(path)`
- or locate above the project repertory and, in the management mode  (`]`), run command `activate Nn` 
    - To locate above the repository, run in REPL
        - `path = "D:/Users/Tmp/"`
        - `cd(path)`

**An easy way** to switch from a local environment (e.g. "Nn") to the global environment is as follows 
- Assume that VsCode is located at *D:/Users/Tmp/Nn/*. In the management mode (`]`), run
    - `activate` to load the global environment
    - `activate .` to come back to the local enviroment "Nn"

### **6. FEW COMMANDS**

#### **REPL**

- `versioninfo()`
- `VERSION`
- `tempdir()`   # Location of the default temporary directory 
- `pwd()`
- `readdir()`
- `cd()`        # Locate in default
- `cd("..")`    # Locate above 
- `cd("./Nn/")`
- `mkdir("dd")` # create sub-directory "dd" under the active path  
- `rm("dd")`    # remove "dd"


#### **Management mode (`]`)**

In a project environmenet
- `instantiate` regenerates Manifest.toml from the existing Project.toml
- `status` shows the installed packages
- `gc` cleans up any packages that arenâ€™t used by any environment

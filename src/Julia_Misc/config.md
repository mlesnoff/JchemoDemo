This script provides some tips about the **installation of Julia and how to start with the software**. It is orientated for Windows users. 

### **INSTALL Julia** 

#### **Download**

- Current stable release: https://julialang.org/downloads/
- For older releases: https://julialang.org/downloads/oldreleases/

During the installation, there is no mandatory need to put a path in the PATH Variable (by default, don't put).

#### **Where is installed Julia**

- By default, Julia is installed at (e.g. for release 1.8.3)  
*C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Julia 1.8.3*

- Packages are installed at 
*C:\Users\your_user_name\.julia\packages*. 

- The pre-compiled packages are at
*C:\Users\your_user_name\.julia\compiled\v1.8*

### **INSTALL Visual Studio Code (VsCode)**

#### **Download**

- https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

#### **Where is installed VsCode**

- By default, VsCode is installed at
*C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code*

#### **Configuration for Julia**

Before to be able to use Julia within VsCode, some configuration is needed.

- Open VsCode

- Install the Julia extension 
    - Go to the icone 'Manage' (toothed wheel at the bottom left of the screen)
    - Go to 'Extensions'
    - Search 'Julia' in the marketplace and install it   

- Connect VsCode and a given release of Julia 
    - Icone 'Manage' ==> Settings ==> Commonly used ==> Extensions ==> Julia ==> Executable path
    - Copy the full path of the file *julia.exe* of the release that has to be used, 
        e.g.: *C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Local\Programs\Julia 1.8.3\bin\julia.exe*
    - If another release (e.g. 1.8.4) has to be used in future sessions, replace the new path in the same way, and re-run VsCode 

- Then a REPL (= Julia command console) can be open 
    - Icone 'Manage' ==> Command Palette ==> Start REPL 
        (or Alt+J Alt+O)

### **CONSOLE REPL**

The **REPL** can be used in two modes:
* The command REPL
```julia
julia>
```
* The Pkg REPL
```julia
pkg> 
```

The command REPL is the usual mode for computations. The Pkg REPL is used to manage packages and project environments.

Typing `]` in the command REPL makes switch to the Pkg REPL, and the backslash makes return to the command REPL.

### **ENVIRONMENTS**

An environment (= list of the used packages and their versions) is defined by files ***Project.toml*** and ***Manifest.toml***.  File *Project.toml* defines the packages attached to the environment and file *Manifest.toml* manages the versions and dependencies of these packages.

To understand and know how to magage environments is very important to develop Julia projects in good ways.
At the installation of Julia, a default environment is created: the **global environment**. It is generally recommended to install only few packages in the global environment. Instead, for each operational study that is developed, it is recommanded to build a specific **project environment** in which its own package dependencies will be defined (*Project.toml* and *Manifest.toml*).

*Note:* In any given environment, it is not safe and not recommanded to modify file *Manifest.toml* by hand. When a package is added to the environment, *Manifest.toml* is automatically updated.

### **GLOBAL Julia ENVIRONMENT**

#### **Where it is located** 
- The global environment (files *Project.toml* and Manifest*.toml*) of all the [*patch releases*](https://julialang.org/blog/2019/08/release-process/#minor_releases) of Julia (e.g. '1.8.0', 1.8.1' etc.) of a given [*minor version*](https://julialang.org/blog/2019/08/release-process/#minor_releases) of Julia (e.g. version '1.8') is located (for '1.8') at 
*C:\Users\your_user_name\.julia\environments\v1.8\*

#### **Upgrade to a new version of Julia**

Upgrade from a minor version to another minor version (e.g. from v1.7 to v1.8)
- See explanations here:
https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/faq/#How-can-I-transfer-the-list-of-installed-packages-after-updating-my-version-of-Julia?

#### **Example: Upgrade from Julia 1.8.3 to 1.9.1**

- Install the new release 1.9.1
- Update the executable path in the settings of VsCode (as indicated in Section 2) 
    and re-run VsCode
- A new directory "v1.9" should be created at 
    *C:/Users/your_user_name/.julia/environments/v1.9/*. If not, create it
- First option (safer)
    - Copy file *Project.toml* from 
        *C:/Users/your_user_name/.julia/environments/v1.8/* to 
        *C:/Users/your_user_name/.julia/environments/v1.9/*
    - In the VsCode REPL, use the "package management mode" 
    (by typing `]`) and type command `instantiate`
    - This creates the file *Manifest.toml* corresponding to 
    the contents of *Project.toml* and resolves automatically eventual compatibility constraints
- Second option
    - Copy files *Project.toml* and also *Manifest.toml* from 
    *C:/Users/your_user_name/.julia/environments/v1.8/* to 
    *C:/Users/your_user_name/.julia/environments/v1.9/*
    - This will define the same environment as under v1.8 (exactly the same package versions) but do not protect against compatibility problems with the use of v1.9

### **5. PROJECT ENVIRONMENTS WITH VsCode**

See:
- https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/
- https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/
- https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/
- https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-setup-project-environments-in-julia-ec8ae73afe9c 

In a simplified view, a project is a directory and, if this directory contains files *Project.toml* and *Manifest.toml*, the project has its own independant environment (project environment).

#### **Open an existing project** 

- Menu "File" ==> "Open Folder" or "Open Recent" 
- Select the directory of the project
- ==> VsCode locates in the corresponding path. This can be checked by typing command `pwd()` in the REPL
- If *Project.toml* and *Manifest.toml* are present, the project environment is loaded
- If the folder is not a project environment (files *Project.toml* and *Manifest.toml* not present), VsCode loads the global environment 

#### **Create a project environment from scratch**

An easy way is the following (many other ways are possible).

- Create an empty directory that will receive the project (e.g. "Nn"), for instance *D:/Users/Tmp/Nn/* 
- Menu "File" ==> "Open Folder"
- Select the directory *D:/Users/Tmp/Nn/*
- ==> VsCode locates in the corresponding path
- use the management mode (`]`) and type command `activate .`
- Install one (any) package, for instance package "StatsBse.jl" from the official Julia pckages repository 
    - In the REPL, use the management mode (`]`) and 
        type command `add StatsBase`
    - This installs the package in the environment, and creates files *Project.toml* and *Manifest.toml* in the directory
    - The project environment "Nn" is now created
- Using the management mode (`]`) in REPL, command `status` shows the installed packages in "Nn"  

#### **Activate an environment** 

Any project environment can be loaded using command `activate` in the REPL management mode (`]`). For instance, for project "Nn" already existing at location "D:/Users/Tmp/Nn/"   
- From any path location 
    -  In the management mode (`]`), run command `activate "D:/Users/Tmp/Nn"`
- or locate directly in the directory of the project and, in the management mode  (`]`), run command `activate .`
    - To locate in the repository, run in REPL
        - `path = "D:/Users/Tmp/Nn/"`
        - `cd(path)`
- or locate above the project repertory and, in the management mode  (`]`), run command `activate Nn` 
    - To locate above the repository, run in REPL
        - `path = "D:/Users/Tmp/"`
        - `cd(path)`

**An easy way** to switch from a local environment (e.g. "Nn") to the global environment is as follows 
- Assume that VsCode is located at *D:/Users/Tmp/Nn/*. In the management mode (`]`), run
    - `activate` to load the global environment
    - `activate .` to come back to the local enviroment "Nn"

### **6. FEW COMMANDS**

#### **REPL**

- `versioninfo()`
- `VERSION`
- `tempdir()`   # Location of the default temporary directory 
- `pwd()`
- `readdir()`
- `cd()`        # Locate in default
- `cd("..")`    # Locate above 
- `cd("./Nn/")`
- `mkdir("dd")` # create sub-directory "dd" under the active path  
- `rm("dd")`    # remove "dd"


#### **Management mode (`]`)**

In a project environmenet
- `instantiate` regenerates Manifest.toml from the existing Project.toml
- `status` shows the installed packages
- `gc` cleans up any packages that arenâ€™t used by any environment

# JchemoDemo

**JchemoDemo** is a repository containing scripts (examples) illustrating some functions of package [**Jchemo.jl**](https://github.com/mlesnoff/Jchemo.jl).

The scripts are available [here](https://github.com/mlesnoff/JchemoDemo/tree/main/src).

The **datasets** used in the examples are stored in package [**JchemoData.jl**](https://github.com/mlesnoff/JchemoData.jl). 

Some packages have to be installed to run the examples [(**See here**)](https://github.com/mlesnoff/JchemoDemo/Project.toml).

When studying a given script, it is recommended to run the code in the REPL row by row (or by block) to observe the corresponding outputs.

# JchemoDemo

**JchemoDemo** is a Julia project (with its own [**environment**](https://github.com/mlesnoff/JchemoDemo/blob/master/Project.toml)) demonstrating functions 
of package [**Jchemo.jl**](https://github.com/mlesnoff/Jchemo.jl). This project is used for trainings. 

Two types of scripts are provided

1. [**Examples with Jchemo.jl**](https://github.com/mlesnoff/JchemoDemo/tree/main/src/Jchemo_Examples)

2. [**Some Julia syntax**](https://github.com/mlesnoff/JchemoDemo/tree/main/src/Julia_Misc)

**Some methodological materials** are available [**here**](https://github.com/mlesnoff/JchemoDemo/tree/main/docs), and **few tips about Julia** installation and environment are given [**here**](https://github.com/mlesnoff/JchemoDemo/blob/main/src/Julia_Misc/config.md).

The **datasets** used in the examples are stored in package [**JchemoData.jl**](https://github.com/mlesnoff/JchemoData.jl) (already installed in the [**environment**](https://github.com/mlesnoff/JchemoDemo/blob/master/Project.toml)).

When studying a given script, it is recommended to run the code in the REPL row by row (or by block) to observe the corresponding outputs.
